It's a [Flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) wrapper to make it cool.

## Compatibility

FlakeHell supports all flake8 plugins, formatters, and configs. However, FlakeHell has it's own beautiful way to configure enabled plugins and codes. So, options like `--ignore` and `--select` unsupported. You can have flake8 and FlakeHell in one project if you want but enabled plugins should be explicitly specified.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user flakehell
```

## Usage

First of all, let's create `pyproject.toml` config:

```toml
[tool.flakehell]
# optionally inherit from remote config (or local if you want)
base = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/life4/flakehell/master/pyproject.toml"
# specify any flake8 options. For example, exclude "example.py":
exclude = ["example.py"]
# make output nice
format = "grouped"
# 80 chars aren't enough in 21 century
max_line_length = 90
# show line of source code in output
show_source = true

# list of plugins and rules for them
[tool.flakehell.plugins]
# include everything in pyflakes except F401
pyflakes = ["+*", "-F401"]
# enable only codes from S100 to S199
flake8-bandit = ["-*", "+S1??"]
# enable everything that starts from `flake8-`
"flake8-*" = ["+*"]
# explicitly disable plugin
flake8-docstrings = ["-*"]
```

Show plugins that aren't installed yet:

```bash
flakehell missed
```

Show installed plugins, used plugins, specified rules, codes prefixes:

```bash
flakehell plugins
```

![plugins command output](./assets/plugins.png)

Show codes and messages for a specific plugin:

```bash
flakehell codes pyflakes
```

![codes command output](./assets/codes.png)

Run flake8 against the code:

```bash
flakehell lint
```

This command accepts all the same arguments as Flake8.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few ideas what you can contribute:

+ Improve documentation.
+ Add more tests.
+ Improve performance.
+ Found a bug? Fix it!
+ Made an article about FlakeHell? Great! Let's add it into the `README.md`.
+ Don't have time to code? No worries! Just tell your friends and subscribers about the project. More users -> more contributors -> more cool features.

Run tests is using [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest):

```bash
pytest -v
```

Bug-tracker is disabled by-design to shift contributions from words to actions. Please, help us make the project better and don't stalk maintainers in social networks and on the street.

Thank you :heart:
